# Computational techniques for recognising handwritten digits

This project encompasses a range of neural and non-neural model implementations to classifiy MNIST digits.

The goal is to compare the performance of each technique including details of hyper-parameters, training ans testing errors, training and testing duration and additional parameters used in the analysis.
